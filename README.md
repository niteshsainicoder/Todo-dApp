## About

My first dApp Todo-dApp. I make this using Solidity, Etherjs, Nextjs. This Todo is same as any other todo app but in this i not added any complete todo button for showing that the todo is compeleted but you can easily delete the todo on completion. 

And also use testEther for use this Todo-dApp.

and also please left a start here if you come here. I am very eager to add many more dApp in my resume to standout in this crowed.

## Features

- Add Todo
- update Todo
- Delete Todo

I knowüòú these feature's are same as ordinary todo app but they show i am able to read data from blockchain and also write data on blockchain ‚ò∫Ô∏è .
